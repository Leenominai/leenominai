Hello! My name is Alexander, and I'm an aspiring developer with a keen interest in Python, Django, Docker, PostgreSQL and CI/CD. My journey into the world of development began at Yandex.Practicum, where I successfully completed a Python developer training program. Currently, I actively participate in collaborative pet projects, aiming to gain experience and grow in the fields of Backend development and DevOps. I particularly enjoy creating elegant and efficient solutions.

I see incredible opportunities for self-development and continuous learning in the IT industry. Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities in Backend development and DevOps, where I can apply my knowledge and skills and continue to grow as a professional. If you have any exciting opportunities or questions, I would be delighted to connect!
